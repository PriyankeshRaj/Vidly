# vidly
I have coded a django app, with the help of the django tutorial, the name of the web application is vidly.
With the help of db Browser (sqlite), I was able to maintain the database.
With the help of django HTML and bootstrap , I created four Webpages: base.html, home.html, detail, html and index.html.
Using the app one can enter the details of movies, with genre, the stock and the daily rate of the movie and can view these detail in a table.
Then finally I deployed the project on Heroku.
